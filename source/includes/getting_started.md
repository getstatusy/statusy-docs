# Getting Started

Statusy is a simple application for communicating the current status of your platform to your customers. Getting started is very easy and only takes a few steps.

## Registration

You can register for a new account [here](https://statusy.co/auth/register). The registration process is straight forward, and you can make changes to everything that you enter here later.

The most important part of this form is your company name. This shows up on your public status page.

After you have submitted this form you will receive a confirmation email. Once you click on the confirmation link and log into your account you are ready to begin creating your status page.

## Main Dashboard

Once you have confirmed your account and have logged in you will be redirected to the main application dashboard. This is where you will spend most of your time while using Statusy.

### Services

Services are the individual parts of your infrastructure that you want to display statuses for. This can be things like web hosts, database servers, API servers, and even external dependencies that your application relies on.

Clicking on the **Add New Service** button will allow you to add a new service. You can add as many services as you wish. You can always add, remove, or modify any services that you add here.

### Open Incidents

Open Incidents display all of the current issues with your platform. This is where you will manage incidents when things go wrong.

### Incident History

Incident History displays everything that has happened with your services over time. This will only show closed incidents.

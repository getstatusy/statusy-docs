# Using the API

Statusy has a fully functional RESTful API. When using the API be sure to [check out the API Documentation](https://api.statusy.co/).

In order to use the API you must first create a token. API Tokens are issued at the user level.

![API Token Generation](api.png)

1. Navigate to your [profile page](https://statusy.co/profile).
2. Select the **Generate API Token** Button.
3. Copy the token and put it somewhere safe. Once you navigate away from the page you will not be able to see the token again.

You can generate a new token at any time by clicking on the **Generate API Token** button. This will remove the previous token that was associated with your user.

If you wish to disable API access via a token completely select the **Deactivate API Token** button.

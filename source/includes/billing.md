## Free Preview

We offer an unlimited preview window that requires nothing more than your email to
sign up.

During your preview you can do just about everything Statusy offers including add services,
customize your status page, invite users to your account and so on.

The preview is meant to let you get a feel for what Statusy offers and make sure it is
a great fit for you and your business or application!

## Publish a status page

Once you are ready to release your brand new status page to the world you'll need to
purchase a subscription.

We believe in making things as simple as possible so we have one plan that is $15.00 USD per month.

You can purchase a subscription by clicking the [Publish Status Page](https://statusy.co/billing/checkout) button on the dashboard.

From there you'll be brought to a checkout screen. Here, you will have the opportunity to add a promotional
code if you have one. If not, click "Pay with Card" to trigger the Stripe checkout screen.

After you supply your credit card information click the "Pay $15.00" button to submit your order.

Once your order is completed you will see a summary of your order.

## Billing information

All of your billing information including your last payment amount, your renewal date and options
to edit your subscription can be found on the [billing page](https://statusy.co/settings#billing).

## Cancel subscription

You can cancel your subscription at any time on the [billing page](https://statusy.co/settings#billing) by clicking the "Cancel Subscription"
button.

![CANCELBUTTON](https://f25ff1f45b31ac95799b-c4efeeed29e42bc2dc22d4fe0fc87f82.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/billingdocsinfo.PNG)

When a subscription is canceled, the cancellation date is set to the old paid through date of your subscription.

For example, if your subscription is paid through 01/01/2017 and you cancel your subscription on 12/12/2016 your
subscription will remain active until 01/01/2017. Once 01/01/2017 has passed you will not be billed again and your
subscription will cancel.

## Restart subscription

If you have canceled your subscription previously and would like to continue using a Statusy status page you can
restart your subscription at any time on the [billing page](https://statusy.co/settings#billing).

One of two things will happen from there - if your paid through date is still in the future your subscription
will be automatically reactivated without further payment. You will be billed again on your paid through date as shown
on the [billing page](https://statusy.co/settings#billing).

If your subscription's paid through date is in the past you will see the checkout screen as shown above and you will
need to enter your credit card information again.

# Connecting to Twitter

Statusy has a Twitter integration built in which allows you to automatically update all of your Twitter followers any time that there is an incident. We recommend setting up a separate Twitter account for Status Notifications so that your users have an easy way of opting in to these sorts of updates.

In order to connect to your Twitter account, navigate to the [Settings](https://statusy.co/settings) page and click on the **Connect Twitter** Button.

This will open up an authorization window on Twitter.

Sign in with your Twitter Account to grant access to Statusy. Once you have done this, Statusy will automatically tweet on your behalf whenever you open, update, or close an incident.
